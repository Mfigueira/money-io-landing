# Money IO Landing Page

## What is this?

This is a project I made to apply modern JS (ES6+) concepts.

It was based on the lectures of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann

## Is it hosted somewhere?

Yup! It's uploaded on GH Pages [here](https://mfigueira.github.io/money-io/).
